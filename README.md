# Website-of-a-Cafe
My first project is about a website for a café, named Joker Café and located in the island of Kythnos. It is not a real shop, but made up for a project of a Web Development class in university. The code is written in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. The content includes: general info, menu, photos, area map, social media, a tourist guide of the island (photos, text and video). The website is available in both Greek and English. Files included in the code are: cache, style, script and normalize.
